Welcome to [funci√≥](http://func.io)! This is a blog where we talk about functional programming and, specially, [scala](http://scala-lang.org).
This is a new version of the blog that is [open source](http://github.com/funcio/funcio.github.io) and made with [Hexo](https://hexo.io/). The old blog is still availabe on [tumblr](http://funcio.tumblr.com).

It is difficult to blog regularly and this is not our intention. But, on the other hand, we have some interesting conversations in our internal #scala channel on slack and we wanted a place where we could explore in detail the ideas we talk about there and, at the same time, to share these stories with the world.

As a result, most of the articles will be about things we find in our day-to-day use of scala which we think is a good thing :)
